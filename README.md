# Thibault Tubiana, PhD.

## About me

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow the [I2BC institute](https://www.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr) (Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell) in the [IMAPP](https://www.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/equipe-interactions-and-assembly-mechanisms-of-proteins-and-peptides/) Team. I work with moledular modelling and molecular dynamic simulation on viral proteins (Hepatitis E, Hepatitis C, Norovirus) and their interaction with biological membranes.  

I was previously at the the University of Bergen in Nathalie Reuter's group working on the depiction of peripheral membrane protein membrane binding site.  
I also worked at the Servier research institute (as a postdoctoral fellow) where I developed new methods to increase their bioisosteric molecular 3D fragment knowledge.   

During my Ph.D., supervised by Dr. Stephane Bressanelli and Dr. Yves Boulard at the French Atomic Energy Commission (Paris Saclay), I studied the norovirus capsid self-assembly using molecular dynamics, homology modeling, protein/protein docking but also some experiments with S.A.X.S data acquisition and interpretation.  

I love Structural bioinformatic, Molecular Modelling, Molecular Dynamics and 3D visualisation.
