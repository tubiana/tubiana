# Thibault Tubiana, PhD

## About Me

I am currently a CNRS Researcher (CRCN) at the [I2BC Institute](https://www.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr) (Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell), in the [IMAPP Team](https://www.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/equipe-interactions-and-assembly-mechanisms-of-proteins-and-peptides/). My research focuses on molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of viral proteins (Hepatitis E, Hepatitis C, Norovirus) and their interactions with themselves, human proteins and biological membranes (_working a lot with AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3 and derivates_).

Previously, I worked in [Nathalie Reuter’s group](https://cbu.w.uib.no/reuter-group/) at the University of Bergen, where I studied the membrane-binding sites of peripheral membrane proteins.  
I also held a postdoctoral position at the Servier Research Institute, developing new methods to expand their 3D bioisosteric fragment library.

During my Ph.D., under the supervision of Dr. Stéphane Bressanelli and Dr. Yves Boulard at the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA, Paris-Saclay), I investigated Norovirus capsid self-assembly using molecular dynamics, homology modeling, protein-protein docking, and SAXS data acquisition and interpretation.

I am passionate about structural bioinformatics, molecular modeling, molecular dynamics, and 3D visualization.
